As the new fields are being discovered recently, NCS theatre keeps its crucial role both for E&P and gas markets in Europe. 

This open source Python project aims to display the location, geometries, and details of NCS fields fast and efficiently. With the help of Folium and Plotly libraries, an interactive map based on Leaflet.JS achieves this goal by including various features as well. This way the main advantage becomes the tracking of fields locally.

Publicly available NCS dataset at https://www.sodir.no/en/facts/data-and-analysis/open-data/, provided by Norwegian Offshore Directorate (NOD), composes the basis and enriches the outcomes of the project. Generated map view not only illustrates the fields but also allows the investigation of geological features such as faults, domes and surfaces. In addition, logistical elements depicting Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), shipping lanes, and country borders are implemented.
